# Branch-Predictor
A two-level branch predictor featuring a 2-bit saturating counter. This simulator operates on a branch instruction trace file, detailing the program counter (PC) for each branch and its outcomeâ€”Taken (1) or Not Taken (0). Upon simulation completion, the output file denotes the prediction outcomes for each branch within the trace.
